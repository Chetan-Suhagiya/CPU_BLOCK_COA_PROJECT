# CPU_BLOCK
This project features a modular CPU built using Logisim, a graphical tool for designing and simulating digital logic circuits. The CPU_BLOCK_CHETAN.circ file represents a basic processor capable of fetching, decoding, and executing instructions. It is ideal for academic use and helps learners understand CPU operation at the hardware level.
